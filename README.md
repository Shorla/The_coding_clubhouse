# The_coding_clubhouse

This repository contains the source code for the official **NGO Website**, built to showcase our mission, projects, and activities while engaging supporters and volunteers.  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure of the site  
- **CSS3 + Tailwind CSS** â€“ Styling and utility-first design framework  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ Interactivity and dynamic content  
- **Figma** â€“ UI/UX design reference  
- (Optional debate: React may be considered later as the team grows)
